I have always had an analytic mind and an affinity for sciences and computers. With a quick grasp, adaptability and ability to establish connections, I enjoy taking on new challenges.
<!-- Being open and sociable, I quickly integrate in a new environment. -->

With a strong background in theoretical and computational sciences, I enjoy working at the exciting interface between science and IT. Throughout my studies of physics and chemistry, I have worked extensively with Linux systems and enjoyed engineering software.

Following my technical interests, I took on a position as a Linux systems administrator. My responsibilities include IT infrastructure, software engineering, DevOps as well as user experience and customer contact. Quickly familiarising myself with the existing systems and employing current technical developments, I gained insight into a wide range of current tools and technologies.

Due to my sense of responsibility and diligence, I've been entrusted with significant responsibilities and leading new projects early on.
I thrive in team settings, leveraging my interpersonal skills to contribute to team dynamics and organisational success.
I have significant experience in teaching and together with a strong ability for empathy, I easily appreciate other's position and transfer knowledge at the appropriate level.

In my work as a doctoral student in theoretical chemistry, I worked at the interface between theory and computational sciences with a strong emphasis on programming. Starting from the development of the underlying theory, I implemented my findings in a sophisticated program package for quantum chemistry. My dissertation is in the final phase of thesis-writing. 

Outside of work I enjoy bouldering, cycling, hiking, cooking, photography and crafts among others.
