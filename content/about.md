I have always had an analytic mind and an affinity for sciences and computers. With a quick grasp, adaptability and ability to establish connections, I enjoy taking on new challenges, evident from repeatedly changing my research subject and field of work. Being open and sociable, I quickly integrate in a new environment. 

Working in teams has taught me about creating solutions collaboratively and project management aspects. I use my structured thinking to help reorganising my environment for efficiency. Aided by considerable teaching experience, I appreciate adaptable and individual approaches to work, along with tailoring communication to a situation.

In my current position I have the opportunity to follow my technical interests and to learn more about tools and knowledge for systems administration. Due to my reliability and independence I was given significant responsibilities early on, taking decisions and developing solutions largely autonomously. I have taken a great interest in various aspects of the organisation, looking to establish connections with other teams and contributing beyond the scope of my position. 

Outside of work I have broad interests and maintain a healthy balance by being active.
